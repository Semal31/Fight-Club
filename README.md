My partner, Semal Shah, and I, Brendan Thomas, created this website for the fictitious online retail store called Fight Club. Fight Club is a place to buy one of a kind bulletproof gear including a bulletproof shirt made for both men and women. We both strive to be more technologically advanced than our current state and wish to use these skills to not only make a fine website, but to also go further.

Our website was created in order to allow people who are in need of the services of Fight Club to help a customer buy whatever they want.

Website Features:

•	We have seven tables in our database
• Fully functioning login system and order form 
• Descriptions of items and prices come from the database

Thank you for taking the time to check out our website, we really appreciate it!
